FEATURES IF ETHEREUM

Ethereum is like an extension of Bitcoin.
Ethereum provides decentralised virtual machine, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
Ethereum miners are rewarded for their computational performance to secure the blockchain with Ether cryptocurrency.
Pricing method used in Ethereum is called as Gas.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ETHEREUM AND BLOCKCHAIN :

Ethereum networks contain executable codes called smart contracts which are not needed in Bitcoin.
Block time in Ethereu is lesser than that of Bitcoin i.e. the block time for Ethereum block is about 14 seconds whereas for Bitcoin is about 10 minutes.
Ethash algorihtm is used in Ethereum and SHA-256 algorithm is used in Bitcoin.
Mining of ether generates new coins at a consistent rate where as in bitcoin the number of coins halves every 4 years.
Transaction fees varies on the basis of computational complexity inethereum and varies on the basis of transaction size in bitcoin.
